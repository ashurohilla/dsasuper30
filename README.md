Title: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository

Description:
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions, along with setup instructions for Visual Studio. The repository is organized to help you practice and implement various DSA concepts. It also provides a convenient method for testing your solutions using input and output text files.

Repository Structure:

dsa_questions: This directory contains a variety of DSA questions in separate subdirectories, each with its own source code files.

question1:
question1.cpp - Source code for the first DSA question.
input.txt - Sample input file for question 1.
output.txt - Expected output for question 1.
question2:
question2.cpp - Source code for the second DSA question.
input.txt - Sample input file for question 2.
output.txt - Expected output for question 2.
...
setup: This directory contains setup files for Visual Studio.

dsa_practice.sln - Visual Studio solution file that includes all DSA questions.
dsa_practice.vcxproj - Visual Studio project file with configurations.
input.txt - Sample input file to be used with your code.
output.txt - The expected output corresponding to the input.txt file.


Instructions for Visual Studio Setup:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code



Open Visual Studio.

Click on "File" -> "Open" -> "Project/Solution" and select dsa_practice.sln from the "setup" directory.

In Visual Studio, you will see all the DSA questions in the Solution Explorer. You can select the question you want to work on.

Write your code for the selected question in the appropriate source file (e.g., question1.cpp for Question 1).

Compile and run your code to test it. You can use the provided input.txt and compare the output to the expected output in output.txt to verify correctness.

Repeat steps 4-6 for other questions as needed.

This repository is a valuable resource for practicing DSA questions, and the setup allows you to easily test your solutions using input and output files. Happy coding!
